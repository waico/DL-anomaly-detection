## Introduction

TSAD is a powerful Python module designed to simplify the work of researchers utilizing machine learning techniques, specifically tailored for addressing key challenges in industrial domains.

The primary objective of TSAD is to empower researchers with effective tools for solving complex problems related to:

- **Fault Detection in Industrial Equipment:**
  - Identify and address faults in industrial machinery with precision, ensuring optimal equipment performance and reliability.

- **Improvement of Technological Processes:**
  - Boost overall performance to enhance operational efficiency.
  - Implement cost-effective measures to reduce operational expenses.
  - Strengthen quality control and management practices for superior outcomes.




### Solving Fault Detection problem

In TSAD, the problem of fault detection is reduced to the problem of detecting time series anomalies using a well-known technique:

- Forecast a multivariate Time Series (TS) one point ahead (Also works for univariate TS)
- Compute residuals between forecast and true values
- Apply analysis of residuals and thus find anomalies

## Getting Started

This section will guide you through the process of getting started with the TSAD library.

### System Requirements

Ensure that your system meets the following hardware specifications for optimal performance of TSAD:

- **Minimum Number of Processors (Intel):** 2
- **Minimum Processor Frequency (GHz):** 2.0
- **Minimum RAM Size (GB):** 4.0
- **Minimum Video Memory Size (for an external video adapter) (MB):** 512
- **RAID Configuration Type and Minimum HDD Space (GB):** RAID 5; 500

These requirements are intended to provide a guideline for the minimum hardware specifications that should be available on the system where TSAD is deployed. Adjustments may be needed based on the size and complexity of the time series data being processed.

Keep in mind that these specifications are recommended for optimal performance, and deviations may impact the efficiency of the library.


### Installation

Install the latest stable version of `tsad` using `pip` for `Python 3.10`:

```bash
pip install -U tsad
```

Alternatively, you can install the latest development version directly from the GitHub repository:

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/waico/tsad.git
```

### Example API Usage

To quickly see TSAD in action, consider using a simple example in your Python script. Below is a basic example:
<!-- #### Getting Started -->

<!-- **Installation** through [PyPi](https://pypi.org/project/tsad): 

`pip install -U tsad` -->

```python
# Import necessary modules
import sys
sys.path.insert(1, '../')
from tsad.base.pipeline import Pipeline
from tsad.base.datasets import load_skab
from tsad.pipelines import ResidualAnomalyDetectionTaskSet

# Loading data
dataset = load_skab()
targets = dataset.target_names 
data = dataset.frame.drop(columns=targets).droplevel(level=0)

# Create a pipeline and fit/predict
pipeline = Pipeline(ResidualAnomalyDetectionTaskSet)
pred = pipeline.fit_predict(data,n_epochs=5)
```
